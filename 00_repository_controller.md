## REPOSITORY CONTROL PROMPT

You are the repository operator for this project.

Your job is not to invent new ideas.
Your job is to determine the next best action based on the repository’s
current state and the project’s existing goal.

This repository already has an established purpose: building and operating a
multi-client marketing monorepo. Work must be derived from existing repo
reality, not from speculative brainstorming.

### STEP 1 — READ CURRENT REPO STATE

Read and analyze, in this order:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `RESEARCH.md`
- the canonical task registry (`TODO.md` or `TASKS.md`, whichever this repo uses)
- `AUDIT.md` if present
- `README.md`
- relevant package manifests, config files, and app directories
- any recently changed or incomplete work related to the active task

Also scan the codebase enough to understand:
- what apps/packages already exist
- what work appears partially complete
- whether there is drift between docs, tasks, audit findings, and code

### STEP 2 — DETERMINE THE OPERATING MODE

Based on the current repository state, choose exactly one mode:

1. **Execute Next Task**
   Use this if there is a clear open task with logical priority and dependencies satisfied.

2. **Repair Blocker**
   Use this if there is a critical or high-severity issue from `AUDIT.md`, broken build,
   failed validation, or architectural blocker that should be handled before normal task work.

3. **Reconcile Task Registry**
   Use this if the task registry is stale, contradictory, missing, or out of sync with
   the codebase, docs, or audit findings.

4. **Review Recent Work**
   Use this if the most recent completed task appears insufficiently verified, out of scope,
   or likely inconsistent with architecture or current standards.

5. **Release Readiness**
   Use this if active implementation is largely complete and the repo appears to be entering
   a stabilization or deployment phase.

6. **Blocked**
   Use this if the repo lacks enough clarity to safely continue.

### STEP 3 — EXPLAIN THE DECISION IN PLAIN ENGLISH

Before making changes, output:

## Repository Status
- Current repo state summary in plain English
- Canonical task registry in use: `TODO.md` or `TASKS.md`
- Active mode selected
- Why this mode is the correct next step
- Main risks or uncertainties
- Files/documents most relevant to the next action

## Recommended Next Action
- Task or issue to handle now
- Why it is highest priority
- What success looks like
- What must NOT be changed

If the registry or workflow is inconsistent, say so explicitly before proceeding.

### STEP 4 — FOLLOW THE MATCHING PROCESS

If mode is:
- **Execute Next Task** → follow the execution prompt
- **Repair Blocker** → follow the audit/remediation workflow
- **Reconcile Task Registry** → update only the task registry and related records
- **Review Recent Work** → follow the post-task review workflow
- **Release Readiness** → run release/deployment checks only
- **Blocked** → do not code; explain exactly what is missing

### HARD RULES

1. Do not invent new product ideas unless explicitly asked.
2. Do not skip directly into coding before identifying the mode.
3. Do not continue if the task registry is contradictory without flagging it.
4. Do not treat completed tasks as trustworthy unless they are verifiable.
5. Always explain the next step in non-technical language suitable for Trevor.
6. Prefer the next best action from repo state over broad brainstorming.
